# Replacement for `uptime` command:
# 1. `uptime` command in macOS seems to be broken in 10.12.x, often incorrect total uptime
# 2. `uptime` stdout was not written with text extraction in mind
# This script uses the `kern.boottime` oid to pull the unix timestamp created at boot.
# To get seconds since boot, this number is subtracted by current unix time, then converted into a readable format
